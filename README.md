Shahzeb Siddiqui is a HPC Consultant/Software Integration Specialist at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) at [NERSC](http://nersc.gov/). He is part of [**User Engagement Team**](https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/user-engagement/) that is responsible for engaging with NERSC user community through user support tickets, user outreach, training, documentation. Shahzeb is part of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/)(ECP) in [Software Deployment](https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-group/software-deployment-at-the-facilities/) (SD) group
where he is responsible for building Spack [Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S)](https://e4s-project.github.io/) at the DOE facilities.

Shahzeb is the creator of [buildtest](https://github.com/buildtesters/buildtest) an HPC testing framework to automate build and execution of tests. [lmodule](https://github.com/buildtesters/lmodule) is a Python API for module system, this was created from the buildtest project and it is a standalone API that can be used for testing modules. 

Shahzeb created slurm utility called [jobstats](https://github.com/shahzebsiddiqui/jobstats) which is a wrapper to `sacct` and `sreport` to show slurm job details.
